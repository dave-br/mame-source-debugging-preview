<h1>MAME source-debugging preview</h1>

<p>MAME includes a powerful disassembly-only debugger</p>
<p><image>TODO</image></p>
	
<p>This preview extends the debugger to add source-level debugging.
	If you are writing new software for an emulated machine, or happen
	to have the source code for existing software for an emulated machine,
	<strong>debugging with that source</strong> can be easier and more efficient than the
	disassembly alone.</p>
	<p><image>TODO</image></p>
		
<h2>This is not an official distribution of MAME</h2>

<p>If you are looking for the official MAME project, go to <a href=https://www.mamedev.org/>
https://www.mamedev.org/</a>, and forget you were ever here.
</p>

<h2>This is a preview for 6809 CoCo / Dragon machines</h2>

There is a pull request open against MAME that adds
source-level debugging for the 6809 processor on the various CoCo and
Dragon machines.  It is possible that the pull request may need to undergo
many time-consuming changes before it is merged (or could even be rejected
outright).  This preview is a way to quickly get the feature into the hands of
CoCo enthusiasts interested in using source-level debugging while the pull request
is being evaluated.</p>

<p>While this preview only works with CoCo-related machines, I hope this
	feature will be merged so I can assist with expanding it to
	other emulated machines.  The CoCo is just the first step!</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Set breakpoints in source by clicking and hitting F9
</p>

<p>Set breakpoints in command window using label names
</p>

<p>Step through source using F10/F11 as usual
</p>

<p>View symbols, and include them in expressions
</p>

<p>Video demos available here: TODO
</p>

<h2>How to install</h2>

For installation and usage, see the <a href="quickstart.html">Quick Start Guide</a>
