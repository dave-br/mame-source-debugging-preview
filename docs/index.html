<h1>UNOFFICIAL MAME SOURCE-LEVEL DEBUGGING PREVIEW</h1>

<I>This is not an official distribution of MAME</I>

</p>

<p>If you are looking for a build of MAME that includes a preview of the unreleased
source-level debugging feature, you've found it!
</p>

<h2>What is this?</h2>

<p>MAME includes a powerful debugger, which allows you to debug code
running inside the emulated machine.  This debugger is disassembly-only,
which means it disassembles machine code for the CPU being emulated, and
shows that disassembly as you step, set breakpoints, view registers, etc.
</p>

<p>If you are writing new software for an emulated machine, or happen
to have the source code for existing software for an emulated machine,
debugging with that source can be easier and more efficient than the
disassembly alone.  There is a pull request open against MAME that adds
source-level debugging for the 6809 processor on the various CoCo and
Dragon machines.  It is possible that the pull request may need to undergo
many time-consuming changes before it is merged (or could even be rejected
outright).  This preview is a way to quickly get the feature into the hands of
CoCo enthusiasts interested in using source-level debugging while the pull request
is being evaluated.</p>

<p>Set breakpoints in source by clicking and hitting F9
</p>

<p>Set breakpoints in command window using label names
</p>

<p>Step through source using F10/F11 as usual
</p>

<p>View symbols, and include them in expressions
</p>

<p>Video demos available here: TODO
</p>

<p>While this preview only works with CoCo-related machines, I hope this
feature will be merged so I can assist with expanding it to
other emulated machines.  The CoCo is just the first step!  This preview
currently only works with a special build of lwtools, but I may expand
the preview to CMOC and ugBasic for the CoCo if there is sufficient demand.</p>

<h2>How to install</h2>
<h3>MAME</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Go to the <a href=https://github.com/dave-br/mame/releases>Releases</a> page, and
		click on the latest release.  The description will tell you which official MAME
		release that unofficial build is based on.</li>
	<li>You will find unofficial builds there for Windows, Mac, and Linux.  Go to your
		existing MAME installation and overwrite
		your official MAME binary with the unofficial one.  (Rename the official
		build first, so you can revert back to it if you need to!)  </li>
</ol>
<h3>lwtools</h3>
Just as debuggers depend on compilers to generate special debugging information,
so too does this build of MAME require your build tool to generate special debugging
information.  This preview currently includes an unofficial build of lwtools that
generates this information.
<ul>
	<li>From the same releases page above, the description will tell you which
		official lwtools build that unofficial build is based on.</li>
	<li>You will find unofficial builds of
		lwasm and lwlink for Windows and Linux.  (I can't do Mac builds, so if someone
		would like to assist, see the feedback section below.)   Go to your
		existing lwtools installation and overwrite
		your official lwtools binaries with the unofficial ones.  (Rename the official
		lwasm / lwlink first, so you can revert back to them if you need to!)</li>
	<li>The Windows lwtools unofficial builds depend on mingw64, so ensure you have
		mingw64 installed, and that your mingw64\bin directory is on your path</li>
</ul>
